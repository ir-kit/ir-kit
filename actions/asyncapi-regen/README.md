# asyncapi-regen GitHub Action

Regenerate a TypeScript event SDK from an AsyncAPI 3.0 spec on every push or PR — and either commit the result back or open a PR with the diff. Drops in next to a committed SDK to keep it in sync with its source spec without manual `pnpm gen` invocations.

Powered by [`@ir-kit/asyncapi-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ir-kit/asyncapi-typescript). Plugin-compose: pick which plugins emit (types, events const, event-map, dispatcher runtime, amqplib helpers, barrel).

Sister to [`actions/sdk-regen`](../sdk-regen) (the OpenAPI version) — same overall shape, different generator.

## Usage

### Open a PR when the spec changes

```yaml
name: Regenerate event SDK
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['asyncapi.yaml']

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  regen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/asyncapi-regen@asyncapi-regen-v1
        with:
          input: asyncapi.yaml
          output: generated/events
```

### Pick plugin subset

Default emits the full set (`typescript,events,event-map,dispatch,amqplib,index`). To emit just types + events const (no dispatcher, no amqplib helpers):

```yaml
- uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/asyncapi-regen@asyncapi-regen-v1
  with:
    input: asyncapi.yaml
    output: generated/events
    plugins: 'typescript,events,index'
```

### Commit directly back

```yaml
- uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/asyncapi-regen@asyncapi-regen-v1
  with:
    input: asyncapi.yaml
    output: generated/events
    commit-strategy: commit-back
```

### Just regen, leave the diff for following steps

```yaml
- uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/asyncapi-regen@asyncapi-regen-v1
  id: regen
  with:
    input: asyncapi.yaml
    output: generated/events
    commit-strategy: none
- name: Fail if SDK is stale
  if: steps.regen.outputs.changed == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "::error::SDK in generated/events is out of sync with asyncapi.yaml"
    exit 1
```
