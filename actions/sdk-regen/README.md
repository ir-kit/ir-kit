# sdk-regen GitHub Action

Regenerate a Go / Kotlin / Swift / TypeScript client SDK from an OpenAPI 3.x spec on every push or PR — and either commit the result back or open a PR with the diff. Drops in next to a committed SDK to keep it in sync with its source spec without manual `pnpm gen` invocations.

Powered by [`@ir-kit/openapi-go`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ir-kit/openapi-go) / [`-kotlin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ir-kit/openapi-kotlin) / [`-swift`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ir-kit/openapi-swift) for native targets, and [`-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ir-kit/openapi-typescript) (a thin wrapper around [`@hey-api/openapi-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hey-api/openapi-ts)) for the TS target. Part of [ir-kit](https://github.com/ir-kit/ir-kit).

## Usage

### Open a PR when the spec changes

```yaml
name: SDK regen
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['openapi.yaml']

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  go:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/sdk-regen@sdk-regen-v1
        with:
          target: go
          input: openapi.yaml
          output: sdk/go
          package-name: petstore
          # Optional: emit go.mod / build.gradle.kts / Package.swift
          # alongside the SDK so the output is a self-contained module.
          # Per-target meaning of `manifest` —
          #   go: the module path
          #   kotlin: any non-empty string toggles gradle emission
          #   swift: the package name
          manifest: github.com/example/petstore-go-sdk
```

### Multiple targets in one workflow (matrix)

```yaml
jobs:
  regen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [go, kotlin, swift]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/sdk-regen@sdk-regen-v1
        with:
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}
          input: openapi.yaml
          output: sdk/${{ matrix.target }}
          pr-branch: sdk-regen/${{ matrix.target }}
```

### Commit directly back to the triggering branch

Skips the PR step. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger downstream workflows on the push it creates — pass a PAT or App token via `token:` if you need that.

```yaml
- uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/sdk-regen@sdk-regen-v1
  with:
    target: go
    input: openapi.yaml
    output: sdk/go
    commit-strategy: commit-back
```

### Pull the spec from a URL on a daily cron

Useful when the source-of-truth spec lives on the API provider's own site (e.g. Mux, Stripe). The action passes `http(s)://` inputs straight through to the generator's bundler, no filesystem resolution.

```yaml
name: Daily SDK regen
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'   # 06:00 UTC daily
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  regen:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/sdk-regen@sdk-regen-v1
        with:
          target: go
          input: https://www.mux.com/full-combined-spec.json
          output: sdk
          package-name: mux
```

### Just regenerate, leave the diff for following steps

`commit-strategy: none` runs the generator and exits. Useful if you want to bundle the regen into a larger PR your own workflow opens, or to fail CI when the committed SDK is stale:

```yaml
- uses: ir-kit/ir-kit/actions/sdk-regen@sdk-regen-v1
  id: regen
  with:
    target: go
    input: openapi.yaml
    output: sdk/go
    commit-strategy: none
- name: Fail if SDK is stale
  if: steps.regen.outputs.changed == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "::error::SDK in sdk/go is out of sync with openapi.yaml — re-run \`pnpm gen:go\` and commit."
    exit 1
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | yes | — | `go`, `kotlin`, `swift`, or `typescript` |
| `input` | yes | — | Path or URL to the OpenAPI 3.x spec |
| `output` | yes | — | Directory the SDK is written to |
| `package-name` | no | `''` | Override the generated package / module name (Go `package`, Kotlin package path; ignored for Swift / TypeScript — TypeScript output structure is owned by hey-api's plugins) |
| `manifest` | no | `''` | Emit a build manifest alongside the SDK. Per target: Go expects the module path (e.g. `github.com/foo/bar/sdk`) and emits `go.mod`; Kotlin treats any non-empty value as truthy and emits `build.gradle.kts` + `settings.gradle.kts`; Swift expects the package name and emits `Package.swift`. Ignored for TypeScript (hey-api owns the output structure). Empty (default) skips manifest emission so the output is a flat drop-in source tree. |
| `generator-version` | no | `latest` | Pinned semver of `@ir-kit/openapi-<target>` |
| `commit-strategy` | no | `pull-request` | `pull-request` \| `commit-back` \| `none` |
| `commit-message` | no | `chore: regenerate ${target} SDK` | Commit message (`${target}` is substituted in `commit-back`) |
| `pr-title` | no | `chore: regenerate ${target} SDK` | PR title (only `pull-request`) |
| `pr-branch` | no | `sdk-regen/${target}` | PR branch name (only `pull-request`) |
| `token` | no | `${{ github.token }}` | Token used for commits / PRs |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `changed` | `true` when the regen produced a diff under `output`, `false` otherwise |
| `files-changed` | Number of files added / modified / deleted under `output` |

## Permissions

- `contents: write` — required for `commit-back`, and for `pull-request` so the action can push the regen branch.
- `pull-requests: write` — required for `pull-request` to open / update the PR.

In addition, **the repo's "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" toggle must be enabled** (Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions). Without it, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push the regen branch but not open the PR — you'll see `GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests` in the run log. Alternative: pass a PAT or GitHub App token via `with: token: ${{ secrets.MY_PAT }}` to bypass the org-level restriction.

## How it works

The action is a [composite step](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action):

1. Sets up Node 20.
2. Installs `@ir-kit/openapi-<target>` into a temp directory under `$RUNNER_TEMP` so it doesn't pollute the consumer's `node_modules`.
3. Imports the package's `generate()` and runs it against the spec.
4. Diffs the output directory via `git status --porcelain`.
5. Either commits back, opens a PR via [`peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7`](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request), or exits with the diff in place.

No bundling required, so any version of the generator package on npm is callable without releasing a new version of the action.
