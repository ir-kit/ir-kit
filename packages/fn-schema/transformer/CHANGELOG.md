# @ir-kit/fn-schema-transformer

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- c218e3b: `safeRelativeDir` now lives in `@ir-kit/codegen-core`, and the Go, Kotlin and Swift generators share it. A Go `fileLocation` directory such as `./api` is now written as `api`, the same as in Kotlin and Swift. Spec converters that read a file (`.tsp`, `.proto`, Postman collections) now receive the path directly. When `fn-schema extract` finds no files, its result now includes `definitions: {}` and `stats.functionsFound: 0`. Dropped dependencies these packages never imported: `fn-schema-loader` and `fn-schema-transformer` no longer pull in the other fn-schema packages, `openapi-ts-paths` no longer asks for `@hey-api/codegen-core`, and `k6-toolkit` and `openapi-typescript` lose an unused dependency each.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- c8bb71b: - `npx @ir-kit/cli` and `npm create @ir-kit/k6` crashed on start, because npm installed TypeScript 7, which has no JavaScript compiler API. Both now depend on TypeScript 5, and every package that uses the compiler API declares `typescript >=5.0.0 <7` as a peer (`k6-toolkit`, `openapi-ts-orpc` and `openapi-ts-typia` declared none).
  - `ir --version` prints the installed version instead of `0.1.0`, and CLI errors print one line instead of a stack trace.
  - `ir spec diff` prints change paths as JSON Pointers (`/paths/~1pet/put`) instead of `/paths//pet/put`.
  - k6 clients quote query parameter names that aren't identifiers (`"page[size]"`), and scaffolded loadtests pass required query parameters and enum values instead of `{}` and `""`.
