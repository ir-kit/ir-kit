# @ahmedrowaihi/openapi-ts-faker

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- d8b5702: Widen `@faker-js/faker` peerDependency range to include v10 (`^10 || ^9 || ^8`). Matches the dev install and lets downstream consumers on faker v10 install without unmet-peer warnings.

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 6c9e57d: Add explicit `.js` extensions to internal relative imports so the published dist is consumable under strict Node ESM (e.g. direct CLI invocation), not only through bundler-aware loaders.

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 5401075: Renamed `@ahmedrowaihi/oas-core` to `@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-core`; merged `@ahmedrowaihi/aas-core` and `@ahmedrowaihi/asyncapi-tools` into a single `@ahmedrowaihi/asyncapi-core`. Repository layout regrouped under `packages/{shared,openapi,asyncapi}/*`; `asyncapi-typescript` split its internal `lib/` into `runtime/` and `ast/`.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8fec7d2: Extracted spec-host-agnostic tooling (diff + parse) from the `@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-ts-orpc/tools` subpath into a new top-level package `@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-tools`.

  Breaking change for orpc consumers using `import ... from "@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-ts-orpc/tools"` — switch to `@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-tools`. faker and typia bump alongside via lockstep; their APIs are unchanged.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- Unified versioning under contract-kit 3.0. All hey-api plugins now share a version (`fixed` lockstep) and ship from a single monorepo. faker and typia jump from 0.x; orpc moves from 2.x. No runtime API change — the version reset is the change.

  Old standalone packages (`@ahmedrowaihi/openapi-ts-{faker,typia}` from their original repos) will be deprecated post-release with pointers here.
